# mac-changer
We use mac-changer when we in one network with our victim,
and we need to hide our real macaddress
we use module - subprocess - to exexute a system command in different OS

We can change a MAC for all network interfaces (network card, ethernet, Wifi,
bluetooth)


Example: subprocess.call("Command", Shell=true)

In this directory:
File -  mac-changer.py (use for change mac for Linux or Mac)
Directory - Macchanger for Windows - use for change MAC for windows

In Windows we also use a programm - MACChanger

In secure way we change a user input to cli arguments
